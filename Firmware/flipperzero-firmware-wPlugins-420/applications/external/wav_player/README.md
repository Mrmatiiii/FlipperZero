# WAV player
 A Flipper Zero application for playing wav files. My [xMasterX?] fork adds support for correct playback speed (for files with different sample rates) and for mono files (original wav player only plays stereo). ~~You still need to convert your file to unsigned 8-bit PCM format for it to played correctly on flipper~~. Now supports 16-bit (ordinary) wav files too, both mono and stereo!

Original app by https://github.com/DrZlo13.

Also outputs audio on `PA6` - `3(A6)` pin
