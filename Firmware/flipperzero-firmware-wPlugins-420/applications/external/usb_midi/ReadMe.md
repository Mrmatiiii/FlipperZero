## USB Midi Instructions [Thanks to ESurge](https://github.com/ESurge)

- To use Flipper USB MIDI app, make sure you have the FlipperZero connected to your computer and qFlipper is not running.

- If you have any audio software that supports MIDI devices, you can use the FZ as an output source.

- Alternatively, you can use https://signal.vercel.app/ on Chrome or Edge, but it doesn't work on Firefox

- If you're using the site ^ then click Allow when asked for permission to use the MIDI Devices.

- Afterwards, you need to go to Settings on the site and change the output from Signal Factory Sound to only be Flipper MIDI USB in order to hear the notes on the FlipperZero (to test, use the keyboard on the left!)

- To exit, you'll need to do a soft restart, as I don't think an exit key was coded in yet.
