  <para>

    &SCons; offers a robust and feature-rich design for an SC-build
    tool.  With a Build Engine based on the proven design of
    the &Cons; utility, it offers increased simplification of the
    user interface for unsophisticated users with the addition
    of the "do-the-right-thing" <function>env.Make</function>
    method, increased flexibility for sophisticated users with the
    addition of &Builder; and &Scanner; objects, a mechanism to
    allow tool-masters (and users) to share working construction
    environments, and embeddability to provide reliable dependency
    management in a variety of environments and interfaces.
