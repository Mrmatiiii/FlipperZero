Hey there!

Simply drag the folder "CC_CL-XXXX_XXXXXXXX" into `SD/update` using qflipper and then launch the "update" file on your flipper.

Theres also an "Animations" folder. In there you will find a few presets. After updating your flipper, you can move *the content* of any of these folders into `SD/dolphin` using qflipper,
and enjoy some different animations. It will pre-ship with Stock_Xtreme
