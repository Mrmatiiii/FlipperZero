# What is this for
Flipper Zero is a portable multi-tool for pentesters and hardware geeks in a toy-like body. It loves to explore the digital world around: radio protocols, access control systems, hardware, and more. The main idea behind the Flipper Zero is to combine all the research & penetration hardware tools that you could need on the go in a single case. Out of the box, Flipper is filled with features and skills, but also It's open-source and customizable, so you can extend its functionality in whatever way you like, along with the community.
