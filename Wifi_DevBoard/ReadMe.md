# Official info

The Wifi devboard ships with [Blackmagic firmware](https://github.com/flipperdevices/blackmagic-esp32-s2) installed. The Flipper documentation [is here](https://docs.flipperzero.one/development/hardware/wifi-debugger-module), and Blackmagic is [over here](https://black-magic.org/).

Quick start: Connect to the SSID `blackmagic` using the password `iamwitcher` or plug the wifi devboard in via USB.

[Official schematics](https://docs.flipperzero.one/development/hardware/wifi-debugger-module/schematics) can be found in the Official Flipper docs. A [PDF version](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/blob/main/Wifi_DevBoard/Flipper_Zero_WI-FI_Module_V1_Schematic.PDF) is also available.

# ESP32 Wi-Fi Pentest Tool

Check out [Frog's write-up](https://github.com/FroggMaster/ESP32-Wi-Fi-Penetration-Tool) and build for quick and easy flashing! Seriously, it's basically just a double-click now thanks to some error checking and automation. ([You're welcome!](https://github.com/FroggMaster/ESP32-Wi-Fi-Penetration-Tool/compare/v1.0...v1.1)).

# ESP32 WiFi Scanner Module

Another fun project is from [SequoiaSan](https://github.com/SequoiaSan)! Originally designed for an ESP8266, it has been ported to run on the Flipper Wifi Devboard too.<br>
Check out the [Release Info](https://github.com/SequoiaSan/FlipperZero-WiFi-Scanner_Module) and [Install Instructions](https://github.com/SequoiaSan/Guide-How-To-Upload-bin-to-ESP8266-ESP32) direct from the source. (Some pinout info is included there and on my [GPIO page](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/GPIO).)

Sequoia has been kind enough to create a [web flasher](https://sequoiasan.github.io/FlipperZero-WiFi-Scanner_Module/) if you want to avoid the Arduino IDE.

# ESP8266 WiFi Deauther Module (not devboard...)

Yet another fun project is from [SequoiaSan](https://github.com/SequoiaSan)! Only working/designed for an ESP8266, but porting it to run on the Flipper Wifi Devboard is a WIP.<br>
Check out the [Release Info](https://github.com/SequoiaSan/FlipperZero-Wifi-ESP8266-Deauther-Module) and [Install Instructions](https://github.com/SequoiaSan/FlipperZero-Wifi-ESP8266-Deauther-Module#how-to) direct from the source. (Some pinout info is included there and on my [GPIO page](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/GPIO).)

Sequoia has been kind enough to create a [web flasher](https://sequoiasan.github.io/FlipperZero-Wifi-ESP8266-Deauther-Module/). Once you've gotten things flashed, here's some quick instructions [from Discord](https://discord.com/channels/937479784148115456/978425715525582918/1004397635098120274) for accessing the Web Interface: Connect to the SSID `pwned` with the password of `deauther` then use a browser to go to http://192.168.4.1

# ESP8266 WiFi Deauther v2 (not devboard...)

Another deauther option can be found at [HEX0DAYS repo over here](https://github.com/HEX0DAYS/FlipperZero-PWNDTOOLS)! (Full instructions included.)

# [Marauder](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder) install information (easy flash for Windows: [HERE](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Wifi_DevBoard/FZ_Marauder_Flasher))

Direct from the dev WillStunForFood (aka JustCallMeKoko) on Discord - check out [his video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YLTpNo5xa0) too!:

- Plug the WiFi dev board directly into your PC
- Upload the MarauderOTA firmware from source via Arduino IDE
- Use the MarauderOTA firmware to flash the Marauder Flipper bin over WiFi

The first step in the wiki documentation [starts here](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/flipper-zerowhile).<br>
(Then you should have the necessary links to the follow on documentation to get the firmware installed.)

ESP32-S2 is the correct board if you are installing on the Flipper WiFi Dev Board. <br>
If you are using the Marauder OTA method, you shouldn't have to install any libraries. <br>
The only other thing you should have to install is the boards for the ESP32 in the Arduino IDE and the drivers for the ESP32-S2.

You can connect to Marauder in a handful of ways (make sure qFlipper is CLOSED):<br>
- Through Flipper's USB-C on a computer ([PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) is good for Windows, find the COM port with [USB Device Tree View](https://www.uwe-sieber.de/usbtreeview_e.html).)<br>
- If you'd rather go direct to the devboard, plug it in directly and give PuTTY a go like above.<br>
- If you have an Android phone, many have had success with the [Serial USB Terminal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kai_morich.serial_usb_terminal) app.

Commands `channel`, `scanap`, `sniffbeacon`, `sniffdeauth`, `sniffpmkid`, `stopscan`, `clearap`, `ssid`, `update`

## LED info when using Marauder

Blue is sniffing<br>
Red is attacking

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SSID Command

The `ssid` command is to edit the SSID list used for beacon attacks for when when you're running something like `attack -t beacon -l`<br>
You can also use something like `ssid -a -g 4` to randomly generate four SSIDs to the list. (Check it with `list -s` to see them!)<br>
To add an SSID by name, use `ssid -a -n YourSSID` and replace `YourSSID` with the SSID name you would like.<br>
Lastly, to remove an SSID from the list, use `list -s` then `ssid -r #` replacing # with the number from the list command.

There is more to play with regarding ssid commands! From [cococode](https://discord.com/channels/937479784148115456/937489970007003166/1004839175238979625), you can do this:<br>
1. ssid -a -n (name you want to show)<br>
2. list -s<br>
3. select -s (index from list)<br>
4. attack -t beacon -l<br>
5. attack -t rickroll

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To update the installed FW, you can use the `update -w` option, then follow along from [Step 8 in the install guide](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/installing-firmware-via-ota).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example Attack Profile ([from Discord](https://discord.com/channels/740930220399525928/967843558520418384/997185157175988264)):

Use command `scanap` stop with `stopscan` when done.

List all found Beacons from previous steps via `list -a`

Note the enumeration of your target Beacon...

Use `select -a x` command to select your target. (x being your target # from previous step)

Execute chosen attack `attack -t deauth`

Use `stopscan` when done.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Connecting to the devboard with a Mac ([from Discord](https://discord.com/channels/740930220399525928/967843558520418384/998043936977330276))

Open Terminal

Enter ls /dev/tty.*

You will be provided with several USB directories. Select one that has your flippers name in it example: /dev/tty.usbmodemflip_XXXXX3

Add "screen" in the prefix and the baud rate as the suffix to the command after copy pasting.....

screen /dev/tty.usbmodemflip_XXXXX3 115200

Hit reset on the flipper board and you'll see it populate. If it doesn't, simply try the other flipper directory name.

Also from E_Surge: "Flashed esp32marauder directly to the esp32-s2 using the esptool command -- wasn't working until a PC restart and boom. But it took about three hours of different methods, attempts, and finally restarting of devices etc."

Frog also noted that it's wise to reflash the Flipper firmware if such issues are persisting.<br>
Start with the Official firmware, test, then move to a unlocked one if desired.
