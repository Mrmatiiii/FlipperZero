# Deauther V3 Source files 

- Here is the V3 of the Deauther by @SpacehuhnTech, You can use the .faps of version 2 and use this .bin V3 but it will change very little, to see all the changes, you will obviously have to compile the source specifically for the Flipper. This version lacks a Web Interface and support for a Display (OLED), soon I will also post here the faps directly.
