## Now it's as easy as 1, 2, 3 to install or update Marauder on Windows.

1. Download and extract [the ZIP file](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/raw/main/Wifi_DevBoard/FZ_Marauder_Flasher/ESP32-WROOM/Marauder_WROOM_v1.10.zip) above to the same directory.<br>
2. Plug in your ESP32-WROOM or v4 OEM Marauder directly into your PC via USB.<br>
3. Double-click `Flash-WROOM.bat` from the extracted files then choose `Flash` or `Update`.

**NOTE: You may have to hold the boot button while plugging it in or even for the entire duration of the flash!**

* If you choose `Flash Marauder` the script will locate your board and flash Marauder automatically!<br>
* If you choose `Update Marauder` you'll be taken to the Marauder download location to grab a new version.<br>
(Simply download the OLD_HARDWARE BIN file, stick it in the WROOM subfolder by the batch file, and delete the old BIN.)<br>
* If you choose `Download USB UART` the script will open the Silicon Labs driver download.

Current Marauder version included in the ZIP: v0.10.2.20230315 (current release as of Mar 15, 2023)
