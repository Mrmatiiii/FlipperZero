Looking for a Linux/OS X version? [Check out SkeletonMan's Python edition!](https://github.com/SkeletonMan03/FZEasyMarauderFlash) (WIP for Windows too including full automated downloads.)

Looking for a quick video walkthrough on how to use this flasher? [Thanks to Lab401.com, you're in luck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um_acrDaBK4)!<br>
Or if you'd rather have a quick rundown of using the Flipper Application, check out [this summary from haxez.org](https://haxez.org/2022/11/marauding-wi-fi-networks-with-the-flipper-zero/).

## Now it's as easy as 1, 2, 3 to install or update Marauder on Windows.

1. Download and extract [the ZIP file](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/raw/main/Wifi_DevBoard/FZ_Marauder_Flasher/FZ_Marauder_v2.1.zip) above to the same directory.<br>
2. Hold `BOOT` on the devboard and plug it into your PC directly via USB.<br>
3. Double-click `flash.bat` from the extracted files then choose `Flash` or `Update`.

* If you choose `Flash Marauder` the script will locate your board and flash Marauder automatically!<br>
* If you choose `Update Marauder` you'll be taken to the Marauder download location to grab a new version.<br>
(Simply download the Flipper BIN file, stick it in the Marauder subfolder by the batch file, and delete the old BIN.)<br>
* If you choose `Save Flipper Blackmagic WiFi settings` your current Blackmagic configuration will be saved.<br>
* If you choose `Flash Flipper Blackmagic` the script will flash the original Blackmagic firmware it shipped with.

Current Marauder version included in the ZIP: v0.10.2.20230315 (current release as of Mar 15, 2023)

**Once the install has completed, [head over here](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Wifi_DevBoard#marauder-install-information) to learn more about what Marauder can do!**

The [batch file](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/blob/main/Wifi_DevBoard/FZ_Marauder_Flasher/Flash-v1.9.bat) is also included above for review and to track coming changes.
